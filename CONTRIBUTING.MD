### JavaScript Styleguide
All code adheres to [prettier](prettier.io) standards with two differences, found in our [.prettierrc](./.prettierrc):
```
{
	"trailingComma": "es5",
	"singleQuote": true
}
```

You can configre your text editor/IDE to show warnings and errors when you do not follow these standards if you would like. However, **when you make a commit, a prehook will automatically lint staged filed, so there is no real need to worry about styling** unless you want to keep yourself to that standard on your own.
