## Our Mentors

**As long as the mentor knows the language you need help in, they can most likely offer aid even if they have not worked with your particular library**(and most likely has had not listed all libraries they have ever worked with), so don't hesitate to ask.

### @matchai - Matan

[matchai](https://github.com/matchai) is a passionate developer, always out to learn new techs and he properly learns the ecosystem and details of how things work. He likes to keep up to date with the latest techs. He's usually programming in and out of work, likes contributing to open source and mentors for nodeschool so he's good at talking in layman's terms. He's been programming since he was in high school, tinkering with hardware and finding ways to bypass school settings (like changing mac addresses so they'd have an extension on an assignment for example). He knows the javascript ecosystem quite well, so he's the guy to ask if you want the nitty gritty details to exceptionally easy explanations to problems of all levels.

In terms of personality, he's very amicable and likes to discuss techs and is performance-oriented.

#### Experience

Matan is a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) at Shutterstock and had jobs as a QA tester and Frontend developer before that. He studied in Electric Engineering, but was tired of having broken machines during his exams so he just started working instead. He's does dev ops too, although would not say he is an expert at it.

#### I am most comfortable with:

* Javascript
* NodeJS
* git and GitHub
* Vue
* Java
* Selenium
* Setting up dev tools
* Testing
* …

I could probably help with:

* Swift (ish)
